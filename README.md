# Twilio Serverless Functions

This is the backend service for the [Chat Conversations API Client](https://github.com/TwilioLatamEngHub/chat-conversations-api-client) which uses Twilio Serverless functions. [Check it out our Twilio Serverless Toolkit](https://www.twilio.com/docs/labs/serverless-toolkit/getting-started), otherwise feel free to use the code here on your own service.

# Setup

Make a `.env` according to the `.env.example` and add the informations accordingly. After deploying the functions, add both `get-conversations` and `get-token` to the `.env` file in the client side app.
